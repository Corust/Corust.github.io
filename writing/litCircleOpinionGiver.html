        <h2>Book:Aru Shah and The Song of Death</h2>
        <p>Dear Roshani Chokshi,
            Hello, I am one of the thousands of readers of your new sequel Aru Shah and The Song of Death. I just finished the chapter where they know how to bring Mini back and it was awesome! As we near the end of the book I had some thoughts to share with you about the new sequel as I enjoyed it as much as the first book Aru Shah and the song of Death. I couldn’t hold my laughter as I read the start of the chapters when they go to find out that Takshaka the King and the guardian of the Naga Treasury has betrayed Queen Uloopi of the Naga race. I loved how they have distracted the King with the song of Taylor Swift and Despasito. Such a unique way as Aiden is a part Apsara(The great dancers). I also enjoyed how similar to Rick Riordan had some funny moments I kind of disliked the part where they fought the nightmare dogs as how it didn’t affect Aru. I wonder if Aru and Brynne could have used their Pandava mind link as a force to channel the nightmare hounds away. Even though this is a very humorous book I think I have learned that with trusted friends it is much easier than putting bars between you and the social world.
