        <p>My story begins at the airport with my paranoid self guarding my luggage with all cost from everyone. After my friends and I said goodbye to our parents  (because we were going by ourselves with our teachers).My young self thought this process was nerve racking, but it would make me a “cool kid” for doing everything by myself. First, we went to check in and drop our luggage. Then, we went to the endless line of people waiting for the security with their passport, tickets and carry ons. After about 15 minutes of eternal waiting we passed through the security line and went through the gates towards the crowded airport. There was only one single problem, we had almost 2 hours to wait as myself was gripping my bag (that was holding all the money, passports and important stuff) with dear life. After suffering my waiting of 2 hours and chatting with my friend we finally boarded the airplane to another 3 hours of flying in the airplane. As my recalling this story I don’t know why my young self was so paranoid about this whole process, but I guess it was scary for me.
